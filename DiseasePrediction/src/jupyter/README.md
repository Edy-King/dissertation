# Jupyter Notebook for Model Visualization

This folder contains a Jupyter notebook that serves as a tool for better visualizing the workings of the models used in this project. The notebook provides an interactive environment to explore and understand the models' behavior and outputs.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this Jupyter notebook is to:

1. Demonstrate the functionality of the models
2. Provide visual representations of model outputs
3. Allow for interactive experimentation with model parameters

## Important Note

While this notebook is useful for visualization and understanding, please be aware that the actual models used in the project have been redesigned and implemented in the server itself for API access. This ensures efficient and scalable deployment of the models in a production environment.

The server implementation may have optimizations, additional features, or modifications that are not reflected in this visualization notebook. Always refer to the server-side code for the most up-to-date and production-ready version of the models.

## Usage

To use this notebook:

1. Ensure you have Jupyter installed in your environment
2. Open the notebook file in this folder
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook for interactive visualization and experimentation

For any questions or issues related to the production models, please refer to the server-side documentation and codebase.
